Hi Everybody,

Non\-Ad\-M\-D is a software package designed to treat non-\/adiabatic quantum dynamics in condensed phase systems. Non\-Ad\-M\-D is really a collection of quantum mechanical propagation methods, model Hamiltonians and spectroscopic functions all created by independent computational scientists. The goal is to crowd source a comprehensive library of plug-\/and-\/play quantum/classical subsystem models. This modularity enables the users to use a standard set of primitive systems and create more complex derived systems from them. These derived systems will then be compatable with the established propagators and spectrocopic functionality.

Sincerely, Daniel Montemayor
