!!\section PDB_OneTime_SingleLine One Time, Single Line RECORD
!!There are records that may only appear one time and without continuations in a file. Listed alphabetically, these are:

!!\section FieldTypes Field Types
!!Each record type is presented in a table which contains the division of the records into fields by column number, defined data type, field name or a quoted string which must appear in the field, and field definition. Any column not specified must be left blank.
!!
!!Each field contains an identified data type that can be validated by a program. These are:
!!DATA TYPE               DESCRIPTION
!!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!!AChar                   An alphabetic character (A-Z, a-z).
!!Atom                    Atom name.
!!Character               Any non-control character in the  ASCII character set or a
!!                        space.
!!Continuation            A two-character field that is either blank (for the first
!!                        record of a set) or contains a two  digit number
!!                        right-justified and blank-filled which counts continuation
!!                        records starting with 2. The continuation number must be
!!                        followed by a blank.
!!Date                    A 9 character string in the form DD-MMM-YY  where DD is the
!!                        day of the month, zero-filled on the left  (e.g., 04); MMM is
!!                        the common English 3-letter  abbreviation of the month; and
!!                        YY is the last two digits of the year.  This must represent
!!                        a valid date.
!!IDcode                  A PDB identification code which  consists of 4 characters,
!!                        the first of which is a digit  in the range 0 - 9; the
!!                        remaining 3 are  alpha-numeric, and letters are upper case
!!                        only. Entries with a 0 as  the first character do not
!!                        contain coordinate data.
!!Integer                 Right-justified blank-filled integer  value.
!!Token                   A sequence of non-space characters  followed by a colon and a
!!                        space.
!!List                    A String that is composed of text  separated with commas.
!!LString                 A literal string of characters. All spacing  is significant
!!                        and must be preserved.
!!LString(n)              An LString with exactly n characters.
!!Real(n,m)               Real (floating point) number in the  FORTRAN format Fn.m.
!!Record name             The name of the record: 6 characters,  left-justified and
!!                        blank-filled.
!!Residue name            One of the standard amino acid or nucleic acids, as listed
!!                        below, or the non-standard group  designation as defined in
!!                        the HET dictionary. Field is  right-justified.
!!SList                   A String that is composed of text  separated with semi-colons.
!!Specification           A String composed of a token and its  associated value
!!                        separated by a colon.
!!Specification List      A sequence of Specifications, separated by semi-colons.
!!String                  A sequence of characters. These  characters may have
!!                        arbitrary spacing, but should be  interpreted as directed
!!                        below.
!!String(n)               A String with exactly n characters.
!!SymOP                   An integer field of from 4 to 6  digits, right-justified, of
!!                        the form nnnMMM where nnn is the symmetry operator number and
!!                        MMM is the translation vector. 
!!To interpret a String, concatenate the contents of all continued fields together, collapse all sequences of multiple blanks to a single blank, and remove any leading and trailing blanks. This permits very long strings to be properly reconstructed.
